For the python files, there are two main files called faces.py and faces_nodownload.py and six function files called Downloader.py, Cropping.py, Random.py, Gradient.py, Overfit.py and Multiple.py.

A zip file called pics.zip is also uploaded which contains seven folders: baldwin, brace, carell, gilpin, hader, harmon and Fine.

Ideally, running only the faces.py will be enough to generate all the outcomes that are written in the report. 

However, I tried to run them on a CS lab computer and only the downloading part was not working. 

Therefore, if that is the case, unzip the zip file as seven folders to the same directory as all the py files. Then just run the faces_nodownload.py file will also do the same job.

Thanks for paying attention here and wish you a good day!
